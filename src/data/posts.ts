      "I spent my summer in Minnesota building **3Dsem**, a devkit that makes semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds approachable for people who have never touched the tooling around it. Point clouds are just data abstractions of the real world, with my preference being the LiDAR point cloud space. LiDAR has been used heavily in geospatial workflows for decades as a way to capture an environment at multiple phases and measure gross change. The pipelines most devs are used to are very analytical in nature, and with advances in computer vision research in the 3D space, it has become obvious the field is in a major period of change. Incorporating CV techniques into geospatial workflows was a critical focus of mine this summer, and to ease people in, I decided to make the process of semantic segmentation (separating objects from their environment and then labeling them within space) as easy as possible for newer users.",
      { img: '/blog/segmentation-examples.jpg' },
      "Most research code assumes you're comfortable untangling dependency trees and running Docker images before you can label a single point. This, plus the need for newer and better GPU power for inference, has made adoption harder than it needs to be for the people already on the fence. And that's before the training side, which is expensive, time consuming, and often incredibly bespoke to the datasets you are training on, adding an extra layer of complexity.",
      "So my goal was to make inference require zero dependency management or extra downloads for the user, and to make training consistent and easy to share. The trick was modularizing everything. **3Dsem** packages training files and pretrained weights as conda packages, with pixi lockfiles pinned to each model architecture, so installs have no dependency solving or Docker. On top of that I offer an open source GUI that exposes every step of the pipeline, letting users create custom weights with their own data and share them, giving the open source community complete control to make weights for specific datasets or tasks. And for the vast majority of users, the TUI handles fast inference and pulling premade weights for quick results on large data inputs.",
      { img: '/blog/pixi-mascot.jpg' },
      "It's live on PyPI as **3Dsem** and the early reviews from people I've shown it to have been encouraging. Using newer transformer models like Utonia proved quite successful, registering great cross-domain numbers **between 0.81 and 0.89 mIoU** on the most common USGS survey data. I'm still fairly new to this kind of work, so I honestly don't know how useful any of it will turn out to be, but I find it interesting nonetheless, and pointing it at our own hexapod scans this fall feels like the right way to find out.",

      'I spent the summer in Boulder, Colorado, working at the **National Center for Atmospheric Research**. I was part of a larger internship program known as the **NSF SOARS program**, which allowed me to work on one research project with the support of multiple mentors. The program is set up so that you have one primary research mentor who oversees the science aspect, one writing mentor who provides feedback on the writing component of your project, and additional mentors who are optional to best support you during the summer. I also had a computational mentor who helped me with analyzing model outputs, as well as troubleshooting the model when it failed to run. Since I was using a model I had never worked with before, it was helpful to have so much support.',
      { img: '/blog/ucar-hangar.jpg' },
      'My project was focused on quantifying the impact of wildfire smoke on global levels of surface pollution. We were working to contribute to a project known as **HTAP3**, or the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution project, phase 3. This project had a large scope and the overall goal of improving fire representations in models, including chemistry models. **My project contributed to a sensitivity analysis, which aims to understand how fire inputs into atmospheric chemical models change pollutant levels in different scenarios.** We were examining how fires in different regions around the world change global pollutant levels of surface ozone and fine particulate matter (PM).',
      { img: '/blog/cam-precipitable-water.jpg' },
      'Together, my mentor and I chose to investigate fire emissions from North America and Australia. We used the Community Earth System Model version 2.2 to run different fire emissions scenarios and show us how pollutant behavior changed based on where fires occurred. We adapted a global emissions inventory to three separate scenarios: each without fires in Australia, Canada, or lower North America. After receiving the data, I calculated the percent contribution of each region to global pollution levels over the simulated study period. We found that Australian fires contributed **0.599%** to global surface levels of ozone, and **0.141%** of surface PM. In Canada, fires accounted for **0.364%** of surface ozone and **0.221%** of surface PM, and in lower North America, fires contributed **0.086%** to surface ozone, and **0.064%** to PM. We compared it to a full fire simulation to do these calculations. In this sense, it was more of a case study for how regional fires over this study period inform pollutant levels. The overall contributions were so low because these are the average contributions over the whole study period. **Fire contributions to surface pollutants follow a seasonal cycle, and these five-year averages are a snapshot of these contributions.** The workflow we created can be replicated for other sensitivity studies, and more regions will be examined in the future.',

      "This year, we are excited to announce an official partnership with Cornell University Physical Intelligence (CUPI) to build a self-navigating data collection hexapod for the earth sciences, starting with LiDAR collection. CUPI is one of the most inventive robotics teams on Cornell's campus, specializing in the use of AI to improve robotic manipulation and perception. They have previously honed their skills through drone racing, but now with GeoData they are taking steps to apply those skills in the field.",
      { img: '/blog/cupi-sticker.png' },
      "Currently, the majority of LiDAR data is collected from aerial flights, satellites, or UAV scans. Satellites are convenient and offer high coverage, but their coarseness has become a major problem for important tasks like identification. UAV data, on the other hand, is very dense, but it is an expensive initial investment and comes with problems of range, flight planning, and local terrain that take a lot of time and energy to mitigate. The hexapod slots in as a nice in-between: the density is there, and range and availability are fixed by the cheapness of the design and long automated run times.",
      "Dense forest makes the problem concrete. In high-density canopy, coverage from above doesn't always penetrate: the crowns swallow the pulses, and the forest floor comes back patchy or not at all. The future of LiDAR and geotagged data is in data merging, combining passes into improved datasets that no single platform could produce alone. The UAV can cover the tops, the hexapod can cover the bottoms, and the merged cloud gets the whole forest.",

      "This semester we bought an NVIDIA DGX Spark, and it now lives in the ELL, with safe remote access for every GeoData student. It's a deceptively small box: a Grace Blackwell chip, 128GB of unified memory, about a petaFLOP of compute. For a relatively small student team, this brings a whole new world of possibilities to the analysis we can run.",
      "The first thing it unlocks is 3D scene reconstruction. Turning drone passes and LiDAR scans into finished models eats GPU time, and until now that meant doing the cost-benefit analysis of managing rental compute and CPU loading. Now, for smaller datasets, it takes minutes, which matters a lot for the constant iteration needed when implementing new research.",
      { img: '/blog/scene-scan.jpg' },
      "The second is forecasting. Tools like NVIDIA's Earth2Studio put real ML weather models within reach of a team like ours. The plan is to pull coarse global forecast data and downscale it into something that actually says what the lake is about to do, then feed our own station data back in to sharpen the local predictions.",
      { img: '/blog/earth2-downscaling.jpg' },
      "The coolest part, though, is the ability to give students on the team the compute to do their own personal projects. Supporting the independent work our teammates do is extremely important for keeping ideas fresh and building critical skills!",
      "The Spark is also the newest tenant in a bigger experiment: hosting our own infrastructure. The ELL now has a small lab network of its own, with a router, a switch, and a Proxmox hypervisor that runs the team's services, and the Spark joins it as the GPU node. Sensor data will flow over a Tailscale mesh into a self-hosted PostGIS and TimescaleDB database. The plan from there is our own little Slurm scheduler handing out jobs across the lab, spinning up cloud machines only when a job actually needs them and tearing them down the moment it finishes.",
      { img: '/blog/proxmox-lab.png' },
      "Part of that is practical and part of it is philosophical. Hardware the club owns keeps working for whoever runs this team after us, costs nothing while it sits, and teaches everyone who touches it how the stack underneath their code actually works. The long-term goal is a club that depends on big organizations for as little as possible.",
